# CSS Grid Demos - Brownbag 08-02-2019
Some CSS Grid Demos prepared for a Marley Spoon Brownbag learning session


You can open the `.html` files of each folder in your browser to get started, without doing any other setup.


If you want to have some live reload functonality like you saw in the presentation do the following.


Install the dependencies mentioned in `package.json` - in particular BrowserSync - by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

After this has finished, run `npm start`. Browsersync will automatically open a new tab in your default browser. 

Use the interface to jump into the demo you want and voila! 

Please let me know if you experience any issues or think this readme should be updated.

Happy Gridding!
